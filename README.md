# TrajectoryBasedNetworks
This package shows the used of spectral clustering of Lagrangian trajectory network to a Bickley jet flow. 
The advection is carried out using a modified version of a previously developed function by Giuseppe Di Labbio (see : https://github.com/dilabbiog/matfluids/blob/main/PP_AdvectPoints.m)
